# rplace-bot

A bot for the 2022 rplace.
Change config options in the beggining of the python code.
It works for me, it fetches the bg successfully and successfully puts pixels (currently only 1 user).
Oauth token needed. (Fetches automatically from api).

(Will happily accept improvements in the form of pull requests).
Am using pypeteer for this.
